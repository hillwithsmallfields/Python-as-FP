# Python-as-FP
An introduction to Python with an emphasis on Functional Programming.

Steps:

- expressions, numbers
- lists **TODO: mention that `if` here is a different use of `if` from the ternary operator**
- tuples (because we'll need them for multiple-value-returns, and as dictionary keys)
- dictionaries
- defining functions
- - parameters / arguments (previously described as inputs) **this is how far I've got**    *shell*:/tmp/$     return difference * difference
- - assigning to variables
- - returning a value
- - imports
- flow control
- - `if-then-else` (mention it's different from the two other uses of `if` that we've seen)
- - `for`
- - `while`
- - `try`
- classes
