# Python-as-FP
An introduction to Python with an emphasis on Functional Programming.

Steps:

- expressions, numbers *TODO: add ternary operator*
- lists *TODO: mention that `if` here is a different use of `if` from the ternary operator
- dictionaries *this is how far I've got*
- tuples (because we'll need them for multiple-value-returns, and as dictionary keys)
- defining functions
-- parameters / arguments (previously described as inputs)
-- assigning to variables
-- returning a value
-- imports
- flow control
-- `if-then-else` (mention it's different from the two other uses of `if` that we've seen)
-- `for`
-- `while`
-- `try`
- classes

will produce a translated version.
