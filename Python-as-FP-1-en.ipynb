    "This is an introduction to programming using the language Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several styles (or \"paradigms\") for programming languages, and most languages let you use more than one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is mostly a _procedural programming language_, in which programs are made up from _procedures_, which are sequences of commands causing actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "To some extent it also supports _functional programming_, in which programs are made up from functions which return results for other functions to use.  Functional programming has many advantages, including clarity and conciseness, and much of the most advanced research on programming languages concentrates on it.  However, it's not purely for advanced programmers; spreadsheet formulae are also a form of functional programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python also supports _object-oriented programming_, which is popular but is not the panacea that many educators treat it as.  You'll need it to make use of many of ready-written packages available in Python, but it's good to get a solid grounding in other parts of the language first.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will start with the \"functional\" side of Python, before moving on to the \"procedural\" and \"object-oriented\" aspects.  The idea of this is to make it more natural for you to think of the functional solution to a problem in preference to the procedural one, which will help you to write more elegant programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "As well as the practical details of Python, we'll introduce some terms from Computer Science, partly to help you understand what other programmers are saying, and partly because if people have thought it worth giving a name to a concept, it's probably worth drawing attention to it as a specific concept."
