    "Python function definitions take more than one line of text, and in Python multi-line structures are made using _indentation_ (the number of spaces at the start of each line) to indicate the structure.  Function definitions begin with the keyword `def` at the start of the line, followed by the function name and then, in brackets, the names for the inputs to the function.  These inputs are called _parameters_ or _arguments_.  After that comes the _body_ of the function, which ends with an indication of what the function should _return_ to its _caller_.  (Using a function is termed _calling_ it.)  Here's a very simple example to start with:"
