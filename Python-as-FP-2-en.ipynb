    "In the [first section](Python-as-FP-1-en.ipynb) we looked at numbers, truth values and strings.  Now let's move on to grouping data together by making lists.  In fact, we've already seen a special case of lists: strings are lists of characters.  But Python shows them differently, although it makes similar facilities available for both, such as getting the length of them.  To make a _literal_ list (one that is built into the program) you use square brackets.  Details like this are called \"syntax\" in computer science.  This particular piece of syntax is common to many programming languages."
